# Moshi IDE: Federated Learning Ecosystem for Elite Code Synthesis

Moshi IDE is not merely a development environment; it is a distributed, state-aware neural engine designed to bridge the gap between local specialized training and global collective intelligence. By leveraging **Edge-Based Autonomous Learning**, Moshi turns every developer's workspace into a contributor to a "Universal Coding Brain."

## 🏛 Architecture & Philosophy

The project is built upon a **Syntax-First Composition Engine**. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static token memorization, Moshi focuses on the atomic grammar of code—HTML5 structures, CSS3 layout logic, and Modern JavaScript patterns—to synthesize semantically sound code on demand.

### Technical Core
- **Distributed Weight Synchronization:** Implements a Git-based federated sync hub to merge local dataset expansions into the central repository.
- **Autonomous Training Loop:** A background engine that performs continuous self-supervised learning on high-quality code patterns generated during user sessions.
- **Low-Latency Inference:** Optimized for high-performance CPU execution with a tailored context window and deterministic sampling parameters.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Global Brain Sync:** Synchronize local training insights with the central [Moshi Repository](https://github.com/aliyabuz25/Moshi) using the integrated **Sync Hub**.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** A high-end charcoal-palette UI inspired by modern engineering tools, featuring a custom **Monaco Editor** theme and zero-distraction layout.
- **Live Performance Telemetry:** Real-time token processing metrics and training status indicators provided via a low-overhead REST API.
- **Auto-Expansion Dataset:** Every meaningful generation is automatically validated and appended to the local knowledge base, ensuring the model evolves with your specific coding style.

## 🛠 Setup & High-Performance Execution

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **PyTorch** (LTS recommended)
- **Flask & Flask-CORS**
- **Git** (Required for federated synchronization)

### Initializing the Engine
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aliyabuz25/Moshi.git
cd Moshi

# Warm up the brain and start the autonomous loop
python3 server.py
```

## 🧠 The Collaborative Vision

Moshi operates on a **Public-Contribution Model**. When you trigger a `Global Sync`, the following high-level operations occur:
1. **Local Contribution:** Your local training gains (`datas/dataset.txt`) are merged into the staging area.
2. **Global Integration:** The central hub validates and merges contributions from all active nodes.
3. **Universal Pull:** The latest, most refined model weights (`moshi_brain.pt`) are distributed back to your IDE.

## 📜 License & Community

Moshi is an open-source initiative dedicated to democratizing specialized AI code synthesis. Contributions to the core model architecture and dataset composition are highly encouraged.
